# Olympics Athletes Results History

This repository consists of my explorations and insights drawn from the Olympics data of Athletes and Results from over 120 years.</br>

The data could also be found in Kaggle <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results'>here</a>.
